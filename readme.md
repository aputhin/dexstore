## The Back-end

Made with [Laravel](https://laravel.com/) PHP framework.
- MySQL database, using [migrations](https://laravel.com/docs/migrations) for 'versioning'.
- Models made use of the [eloquent ORM](https://laravel.com/docs/eloquent).
- As MVC as possible within the 48h timeframe I had. :)

## The Front-end

- Simple [Bootstrap](http://getbootstrap.com/) layout, making use of Laravel's [Blade](https://laravel.com/docs/blade) engine.
- Also [VueJS](https://vuejs.org/) for AJAX requests.
